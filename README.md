# Breaking-captchas-with-CNN
A simple captcha breaker project done with using the techniques of Image processing and Deep learning.Captchas consists of 4 digit number consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
Dataset is prepared manually from captchas images.Using Contour detection function in OpenCV each digit is extracted from captchas images and manually labelled with a python script.
A convolutional neural network following LeNet architecture was trained on datasets achieving 100% accuracy on both testing and validation data.
